### THROUGHPUT Frictionless Data Testing

#### About
This is a simple repository to test out application of frictionless data given a few boundary conditions.

* The the data in the package is likley not well formed enough (at first) to be described in a CSV that
can be defined by a table schema
* That there are many different files PDF, XLSX, CSV, (binary perhaps), etc that make up a data set of interest
* That we want to expose these for discovery using the schema.org patterns being explored by P418, Google, and others.
